## a boy named ransom

#### denied

a chance at love by the holy     
told that i was nothing     
by the ugly and the lowly     
and i have believed them all     

i ought now to bolden up      
and firmly stand tall     
i shall explain my soul no more     
i shut now the last door

#### gifted

believe you will never     
come across a star like me     
even i do not know     
my full glow     

i need to press it harder     
into the furnace of life     
hit it on the anvil     
of madness and strife     

i am gifted     
twisted and blistered     
a purple diamond     
i will earn a galaxy

#### forgotten

God forgot to make a mate for me     
he or she decided      
i do not deserve companionship     

no love sticks, my heart is bark     
yet i have been burdened     
with a soul of sap      

of honey golden running impure      
able to see love but never sure     

if i was meant to be happy     
then this numbness in me     
ought not to be a reality

## f*ck it all

let me down     
let me fall     
taste the dust     
i will never call     
out for help     
not anymore     

i have waited too long     
at love's door

## ugly duckling

i am kin to none     
in truth, in fact     

my species have laughed     
when i tried to look back     
leave me in my misery      

i am not dark     
_just the opposite of white_

## wolf abuse

puppy dog love     
turns to wolf abuse     

come not to me     
when he does refuse     

**nothing is ever worth, feeling anything**     

perhaps i was too cocky     
and the lord thus decided     
to shock me     

**nothing is ever worth, feeling anything**

## nostalgia

i miss the former days     
when life passed in a daze     

and i knew never time     
nor place     

just after i fell     
like a dark angel     
falselly accused     

from grace

#### my reality

it takes an insect     
in my eye to make me _weep_      

and a prescribed pill
to make me **sleep**

i gamble with machinations     
foster calculations     
just so, i do not feel like **_sheep_**

#### queen

i knew her for half a second    
that was enough     
she is the last    
in a recent rapid succession

to ignore my love     
and my soul rebuff

she had a     
rapid fire spirit     
bright as the sun, was she ...     
she was my new religion     
i stood at her pulpit     

**_now i know_**     
**_i can never serve_**     
**_the god king of love_**

#### nerd for life

i have used up     
two blue ink pens     
during these exams     

of life: reality tutors me     
i obey my teacher alone     
i cannot stop

#### nothing changes

i made my lips sweet     
for a _convo_ that never held     

for a spluttering sparrow     
of a bird     
to become in a triangle     
an unwilling third     

i still cannot share my love

exposed to the sun   
naked like a maiden   
or a mind unborn

that i did not come so often   
to worship, before you fell?

## the show

we are on the waves    
surfing, but never drowning    
screaming but never shouting    
speaking from our souls   

we keep it simple    
open and unspoken    
moving agendas,    
shinying shields, and blades   
mental precision   

**_the show is more than the mic spit_**   
**_we pilot the art - this is the cockpit_**   

on the steady   
clearly ready   
nothing bloddy   
dirty logic   

we are the new scientists   
ancient like kings   
postmodern relics   

we are the new preachers   
teaching the soft religion   
moving like ghosts   
walking like wolves   
we are the new magicians   

**_the show is more than the mic spit_**   
**_we pilot the art - this is the cockpit_**   

we know all our brothers   
we rock all the borders   
we are up in the air   
like bluebirds    

of all the cool faces   
we make up two-thirds   
we are aiming for greatness    
we do what we want to     
there is nothing holding us back

## explain

why can i never    
relay as in ink   
my words, in person - sharper

never bother   
the humble and shy   
are not oft recalled

#### a man 

first and foremost   
thus, i need a companion   

no one can truly breathe alone   

teach me to roam    
across the brightest part   
of Hades' sky    

so i can be the one for you

#### love galore

i can be loyal     
i need someone   
to be so for   

leave me when you feel    
nothing again   
do not just drift   
like golden dust, again   
let me know - **then**

#### chocolates

keep you joyful   
but i

even if, the first soul   
i ever brushed was a gem   

melt upon me   
sigh atop me   
keep it simple   
blunt and free

you might not like   
my ways, my sayings

## last page 

no more stories

## what i have to say

- - -

#### for now

the pain is a game   
a two minute race   
without face   
without pace   

its a mental mirage   
that burns from within   
it soothes too, i must confess   

herein lies the truth   
of my pathetic sin   

[&copy; POETRIQUE](http://instagram.com/poetrique)

#### barsman

i burn bars   
not for ectasy   

but to reclaim    
the key to reality    
my once sober clarity   
my weak hold on vanity   

[&copy; POETRIQUE](http://instagram.com/poetrique)

- - -

#### better already

do i swim or wade through life   
seek out bitter, endless strife   

neither in truth   
i drown each day     

**_in the pool_**   
**_of my mind's tear_**  

[&copy; POETRIQUE](http://instagram.com/poetrique)

## make-believe

thoughts imaginary   
i pull out

with a rabid white rabbit   

there is no   
saving me   
from make-believe

## a-levels

i dropped out to focus

you cannot snore

## del ray

_lana knows my soul_  

i guess  
i think  
i cannot know  

_lana knows my soul_  

she breathes  
pure gold  
yet wants nothing  

_lana knows my soul_

## simple

could love not be  
direct as smoke  

straight as a tree  
other than  
full of glee  

why do we  
claim we know  
what we do not

## lack of

the absence    
of sleep    
means not  
insomnia  

the lack   
of love  
means not   
loneliness  

nothing can  
fill a thing  
that is nothing

## cold poetry

look not    
into my eyes    
_i cannot look back_     

look not    
into my soul    
_its kind of wack_  

my poems  
hardly rhyme nowadays  
_now thats a fact_

## do not

- - -

do not look  
do not see  
do not feel  
do not speak  

_understand_  
_there is no point_  

do not love  
do not hug  
do not smile  
do not reach  

_understand_  
_there is no point_  

do not wonder  
do not ask  
do not bother  
do not sigh

## CONFESSIONS

- - -

#### no one can

see this  
so  
i will no try  

i cannot cry,  
will not be  
heard when i die  

care for  
a half-broken soul  

[&copy; POETRIQUE](http://instagram.com/poetrique)

#### understand

i cannot be  
happy in the  
true sense  

there is a  
rhythm to joy  
i might  
never learn  

[&copy; POETRIQUE](http://instagram.com/poetrique)

#### the way

that i feel  
is not so deep  
not so complex  

truly  
not so slick  
disposable  
as a tick  

yet i strive  
for no reason  
for a season  
of spring  

[&copy; POETRIQUE](http://instagram.com/poetrique)

#### my mind beats

illogical  
balanced and grotesque  

like a jungle  
voltaire  
i think _candide_  

instead  
of my heart  
i need it to feel  

[&copy; POETRIQUE](http://instagram.com/poetrique)

#### ... i need a muse

offers were up  
down to the ground  

no one can hear  
my soul's very sound  

i tire of speaking  
painting, and explaining  

the pits of my being  
and broken lofty peaks
