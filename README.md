## 2 shots

down from on high

## colosseum

exposed to the sun   
naked like a maiden   
or a mind unborn   

you were a palace of madness   
you are nothing but a ruin   
but a dream now   

was it sinful   
that i did not come so often   
to worship, before you fell?

## the show

we are on the waves    
surfing, but never drowning    
screaming but never shouting    
speaking from our souls   

we keep it simple    
open and unspoken    
moving agendas,    
shinying shields, and blades   
mental precision   

**_the show is more than the mic spit_**   
**_we pilot the art - this is the cockpit_**   

on the steady   
clearly ready   
nothing bloddy   
dirty logic   

we are the new scientists   
ancient like kings   
postmodern relics   

we are the new preachers   
teaching the soft religion   
moving like ghosts   
walking like wolves   
we are the new magicians   

**_the show is more than the mic spit_**   
**_we pilot the art - this is the cockpit_**   

we know all our brothers   
we rock all the borders   
we are up in the air   
like bluebirds    

of all the cool faces   
we make up two-thirds   
we are aiming for greatness    
we do what we want to     
there is nothing holding us back

## explain

why can i never    
relay as in ink   
my words, in person - sharper   

the faults i feel i have   
i have told them to you   
you should not remember   

never bother   
the humble and shy   
are not oft recalled

## who i need to be 
 
- - -

#### a man 

first and foremost   
thus, i need a companion   

no one can truly breathe alone   

teach me to roam    
across the brightest part   
of Hades' sky    

so i can be the one for you   

[&copy; POETRIQUE](http://instagram.com/poetrique)

- - -

#### love galore

i can be loyal     
i need someone   
to be so for   

leave me when you feel    
nothing again   
do not just drift   
like golden dust, again   
let me know - **then**   

[&copy; POETRIQUE](http://instagram.com/poetrique)

- - -

#### chocolates

keep you joyful   
but i   
have no sweet tooth   
even if, the first soul   
i ever brushed was a gem   

melt upon me   
sigh atop me   
keep it simple   
blunt and free   

[&copy; POETRIQUE](http://instagram.com/poetrique)

#### deaf man words

you might not like   
my ways, my sayings   
my thoughts and ideas   

but never doubt my   
arithmetic rhythm   
always and forever   

i will prove a deaf man   
spitting on the sun   
cold words

## last page 

no more stories       
to tell     

it is unentertaining       
how often   
i have fallen    

**_one last hurrah_**     
**_for the trip in the sky_**    

the bravest ones    
never win    

and surely too    
those farthest from the truth    
never lie

## what i have to say

- - -

#### for now

the pain is a game   
a two minute race   
without face   
without pace   

its a mental mirage   
that burns from within   
it soothes too, i must confess   

herein lies the truth   
of my pathetic sin   

[&copy; POETRIQUE](http://instagram.com/poetrique)

- - -

#### barsman

i burn bars   
not for ectasy   

but to reclaim    
the key to reality    
my once sober clarity   
my weak hold on vanity   

[&copy; POETRIQUE](http://instagram.com/poetrique)

- - -

#### better already

do i swim or wade through life   
seek out bitter, endless strife   

neither in truth   
i drown each day     

**_in the pool_**   
**_of my mind's tear_**  

[&copy; POETRIQUE](http://instagram.com/poetrique)

- - -

## make-believe

thoughts imaginary   
i pull out   
of my magic black hat   
with a rabid white rabbit   

there is no   
saving me   
from make-believe   

[&copy; POETRIQUE](http://instagram.com/poetrique)

- - -

## assay

often, and with care   
without reflection   
or a drop of fear   

never ignorant   
getting goals accomplished   
evaluate all   
regardless of where

## a-levels

i dropped out to focus   
and study more   
and mentally soar   

you knock on the door

i never sleep   
for in the heavens   
you cannot snore

#### no one can

see this

i will no try  

i cannot cry,  
will not be  
heard when i die  

care for  
a half-broken soul

i cannot be  
happy in the  
true sense  

there is a  
rhythm to joy  
i might  
never learn  

[&copy; POETRIQUE](http://instagram.com/poetrique)

#### the way

that i feel  
is not so deep  
not so complex  

truly  
not so slick  
disposable  
as a tick  

yet i strive  
for no reason  
for a season  
of spring

#### my mind beats

illogical  
balanced and grotesque  

like a jungle  
voltaire  
i think _candide_  

instead  
of my heart  
i need it to feel  

[&copy; POETRIQUE](http://instagram.com/poetrique)

#### ... i need a muse

offers were up  
down to the ground  

no one can hear  
my soul's very sound  

i tire of speaking  
painting, and explaining  

the pits of my being  
and broken lofty peaks
